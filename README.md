# Data Exploration of COVID-19 in 2020

This repository is used for a research project to get insight into the COVID-19 cases that occurred in 2020 based on the public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/covid19-case-surveillance-public-use-dataset).

To run the project, you need to:
- Ensure `python3` is installed on your computer.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where this project is located.
- Activate python virtual environment on your computer. Read [this one](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) if you are not familiar with it.
